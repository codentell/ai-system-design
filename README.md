# ðŸ§  AI System Design Toolkit

Welcome to the **AI System Design Toolkit** â€” a collection of production-grade components for building scalable, LLM-optimized infrastructure. 

This repo includes modules focused on two critical challenges in modern AI applications:

1. **Token-Aware Rate Limiting** for safely exposing LLM APIs at scale.

   
2. **LLM-Text Ingestion Pipelines** for transforming unstructured documents into AI-readable formats.

Learning and making infrastructure for the LLM era.
